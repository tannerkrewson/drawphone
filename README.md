# About
Drawphone was inspired by [Spyfall](https://github.com/evanbrumley/spyfall) and [Telestrations](http://telestrations.com/).

# Development
#### Instructions
1. Clone the repo to get started
2. Run `npm install` and `npm start` to launch the server
3. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser

#### Tips
* To change the default port, set the `PORT` environment variable
* If you set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development`, you can use the link `localhost:3000/dev` to automatically join game `ffff`. This is helpful for speeding up debugging.
* Please branch off of the `dev` branch and use it as the base in any pull requests. The reason for this is that any changes to `master` restart the prod server, killing any in-progress games, so it's best to merge a batch of changes into master all at once to keep restarts to a minimum.
